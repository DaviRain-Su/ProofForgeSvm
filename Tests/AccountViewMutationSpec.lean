Focused checks for `svm-rt-003`: AccountView + lamport mutation share the combined
variable+aliasing Loader-v3 walk. `#pf_build` exercises extraction/emission; `#pf_guard`
pins detection of both capabilities and the combined-walk markers. Behavioral bounds are covered
by Mollusk in `runtime-tests/solana/tests/account_view_mutation.rs`.
