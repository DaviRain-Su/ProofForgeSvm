Focused checks for the SVM-RT-1 bounded remaining-account view via the non-Phoenix
`Examples.Svm.AccountView` consumer. The `#pf_build` commands run the same extraction and sBPF
emission path as the CLI; the `#pf_guard_account_view` command pins the extraction plan, the
runtime walk contract, and the fail-closed emission markers. Behavioral bounds (capacity OOB,
available-count OOB, duplicate keys, short data, signer/writable/owner, atomic state hold) are
covered by the Mollusk matrix in `runtime-tests/solana/tests/account_view.rs`.
