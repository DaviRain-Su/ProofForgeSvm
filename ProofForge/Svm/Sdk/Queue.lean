# SVM SDK fixed-capacity FIFO queue

A reusable account-resident bounded FIFO composed from `Svm.AccountStorage.Source` checked
load/store stubs. The ring layout and sentinel policy are compile-time descriptor data; the
target emits only the same checked one-based account word accesses that `AccountStorage.Source`
lowers to. No new SVM operation, component, IR constructor, emitter case, native pointer,
Lean `Array`/`Map`, or heap object exists at any point.

## Physical-state contract

- `slots`: a one-based, fixed-stride, fixed-capacity payload region; slot `1..capacity`
  each hold one payload word.
- `head`: scalar header word holding the one-based slot index of the front element, with
  `0` as the empty-queue sentinel.
- `count`: scalar header word holding the live element count `0..capacity`.

The ring successor of slot `h` is `h + 1`, or `1` when `h = capacity`; this is computed with
checked add/sub and a select, never with modulo or unbounded arithmetic. All persistent
values are account offsets/indices; `0` is the universal null sentinel.

## Fail-closed policy

- `pop`/`peek` on an empty queue return `0` and perform no store.
- `push` on a full queue returns `0` and performs no store.
- A stored payload of `0` is indistinguishable from an absent element at the `pop`/`peek`
  boundary; callers that need to distinguish them read `size` first or reserve `0`.
- Malformed conditions (unwritable or foreign account, header or slot beyond `data_len`)
  abort inside the target-owned checked stubs with `Custom(1)`.
