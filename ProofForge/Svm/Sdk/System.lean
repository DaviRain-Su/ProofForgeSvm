# SVM SDK System Program facade

Stable source names for fixed-account System Program effects. These functions erase to the
existing generic Runtime invoke contract; they do not introduce plan objects, dynamic account
tables, operations, or emitter recipes.

Fixed geometry: outer account 0 is the signer/writable target, outer account 1 is the System
program.

This is **inbound acquisition only** (system-owned → current program). It is not an
owner-reassign lifecycle for already program-owned accounts (`svm-sdk-002` permanently
fail-closed); foreign-owned targets fail at the System Program boundary. -/

recent blockhashes, and outer account 3 is the System program. -/

## Seed-derived accounts

These calls accept one compile-time ASCII seed and encode its byte length next to the literal.
The extractor enforces the same 1–32-byte seven-bit policy as `Sdk.Pda.Ascii`; account geometry
remains fixed and no seed bytes or pointers enter persistent account state.
