# SVM SDK account and signer handles

Source contracts name fixed accounts, required signers, and bounded remaining-account windows with
compile-time handles. Every accessor is `pf_inline`: extraction erases the handle to the existing
target-owned Runtime leaf or `Svm.AccountView` component query. This module adds no operation, IR
variant, component, emitter recipe, runtime geometry, pointer, or account copy.

Fixed handles contain one static account index. Bounded views contain static `base/capacity`
geometry and one runtime zero-based index; the target checks that index against both capacity and
the invocation's account count before reading. All malformed or unavailable accesses keep the
existing target-owned `Custom(1)` failure behavior.

Move `amount` lamports from the fixed `source` account to the fixed `destination` account. The
two typed handles are erased at extraction, leaving only their static physical indexes; callers
never supply raw offsets, pointers, or ABI markers. The target preflights both writable flags,
source current-program ownership, source balance, destination overflow, and canonical-header
distinctness (duplicate aliases fail closed) before either store; any failure is `Custom(1)` with
no writes. A writable foreign-owned destination may be credited. Amount zero succeeds after the
same validation, keeping the API contract stable. The signed total lamport delta is zero.

Resize one fixed external account's data using the current zero-initializing Solana
`AccountInfo::resize` contract. This is a bounded direct account-ABI mutation, not System
`Allocate`, heap `realloc`, or a persistent pointer. The target checks writable/current-program
ownership, the 10 MiB ceiling, and the 10,240-byte growth budget relative to the invocation's
original length before any change. A shrink preserves the retained prefix; a grow preserves the
old prefix and zeroes every newly exposed byte.

The managed ProofForge State account at physical index zero has a fixed extracted schema and is
not an admissible resize handle. A fixed external position that aliases state account zero also
fails closed. Duplicate aliases among external positions share their canonical account header.

  Runtime.resizeAccountData (UInt64.ofNat handle.index) newLength

/-!
Close one fixed program-owned account by shrinking its data to zero and moving its complete
lamport balance to a fixed refund destination. This is ordinary SDK composition over the checked
`resizeData` and `transferLamports` contracts above, not a new Runtime operation: extraction first
snapshots the source balance, then preserves exactly one resize and one transfer in source order.

The source must be a writable external account owned by the current program. The destination must
be writable and canonically distinct, but may be foreign-owned. Runtime duplicate aliases,
destination overflow, malformed account data, and all other underlying preflight failures remain
`Custom(1)`. Solana instruction rollback makes a later transfer failure atomic with the earlier
resize. No owner reassignment, pointer, heap allocation, or runtime-selected account geometry is
introduced.

## Owner-reassign policy (`svm-sdk-002`) — permanently unavailable

ProofForge does **not** expose a facade that reassigns the owner of an already program-owned
account to another program (or back to System) while the account remains live. Solana's System
`Assign` only re-points **system-owned** accounts; once this program owns an account, the
supported lifecycle exit is `Handle.closeTo` (resize-to-zero + full lamport refund), optionally
followed by a fresh System create/assign. There is intentionally no
`Handle.reassignOwner` / arbitrary-owner CPI helper — half-open owner mutation is forbidden.
Capability matrix status: **n/a** (permanent fail-closed).

/-!
Ensure one fixed program-owned account holds at least `Rent.minimumBalance dataLen` lamports by
debiting an explicit program-owned `payer`. This is ordinary SDK composition over the existing
`Sysvar.Rent.minimumBalance` query and checked `transferLamports` — no new Runtime leaf, Emit
recipe, or implicit signer debit.

The deficit is `saturatingSub required current`, so an already-exempt account still runs the
zero-amount transfer path (same writable/owner/distinctness gates as any other transfer). An
underfunded payer fails closed before any write. `dataLen` must be a compile-time `Nat`.

/-!
Resize one fixed external account after an explicit rent top-up for the **target** length. Top-up
runs before resize so the funded account is rent-safe for `newLength`; a later resize failure
rolls back with the Solana instruction. No new Emit recipe is introduced.
