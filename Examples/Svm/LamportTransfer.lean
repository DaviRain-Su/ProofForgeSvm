Application fixture for the checked SVM lamport-transfer effect. State account 0 is authenticated
ProofForge state; the compile-time `vault`/`recipient` handles name physical accounts 1 and 2 once
and every entry moves lamports between their walked canonical headers. The target preflights both
writable flags, vault ownership by the current program, balance, destination overflow, and
canonical-header distinctness (Loader-v3 duplicate aliases fail closed) before either store; any
violation is `Custom(1)` with no writes and no state change. Amount zero is a validated no-op.

Move `amount` lamports from the vault to the recipient and record the cumulative moved total in
state, returning the amount actually moved. The lamport effect runs before the state store, so a
rejected transfer (non-writable account, foreign-owned vault, insufficient balance, crediting
overflow, or duplicate alias) leaves both balances and the committed state byte-identical.

Close the program-owned vault and refund its complete lamport balance to the recipient. The
reusable SDK snapshots the balance, shrinks account data to zero, and drains the account through
the existing checked transfer. This entry adds no application-specific low-level operation and
does not change managed state.
