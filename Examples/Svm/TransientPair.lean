# Dedicated same-kind transient multi-handle evidence

This example is the non-Phoenix consumer for the two compile-time handle slots of each bounded
transient container kind (`ProofForge.Svm.Sdk.Transient`: two `Vector64` slots, two `Bytes`
slots). It remains independent from `MemoryOps` while the normal `Examples` umbrella and SVM
registry build it as a first-class consumer.

Every method here composes the same shared downward bump heap and the same target-owned lifecycle
interpreter as `Examples.Svm.MemoryOps`; only the same-kind slot isolation, unbegun-slot, and
cross-slot OOM evidence is new. No pointer, descriptor, allocator, or syscall appears in source.
